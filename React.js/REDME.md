# Framework vs. Library

## 1. Framework
- **Definition**: A framework is a pre-defined structure or platform for building applications. It provides the foundation and dictates how your application should be organized and interact with the provided tools.
- **Control Inversion**: In a framework, the framework calls your code. This is known as Inversion of Control (IoC).
- **Opinionated**: Frameworks are often more opinionated, meaning they enforce a specific way of building applications.
- **Examples**:
  - Web Development: React, Next.js, Angular, Django, Rails
  - Mobile Development: Flutter, React Native
  - Backend: Spring Boot, ASP.NET
- **Characteristics**:
  - Provides a skeleton or structure.
  - Guides development by enforcing patterns (e.g., MVC).
  - Integrated tools for routing, data handling, and more.
- **Example**:
  Using Django (a framework):
  ```python
  # Django sets up the project structure and calls your code through views.
  def my_view(request):
      return HttpResponse("Hello, Framework!")

# Framework vs. Library
## Libraries
- Collection of reusable code.
- Reduces need to write repetitive/complex things from scratch.
- You control how/when it's used.
no/few boundaries
## Framework
- Predetermined architecture - you follow a specified pattern of development.
-You work  within the boundaries set by the framework 
- "Right" and "wrong" ways to use it.

# Why React?
### It's Composable!
Can create easily reusable and interchangeable "pieces of the web" that can be combined in various ways to create complex systems

### Declarative vs imperative
- Declarative: "What should be done"?
"Just tell me what needs to happen, and I'll worry abut how to done"
- Imperative: "How should it be done"?
"Describe to me every step on how to do something,and i wll do it."
